## Our Project Using Google Cloud Platform
### Description
For Design Architecture, we use Cloud Function and Cloud Run to deploy the application. For Cloud Function using Express JS for the local server, and the database using Firestore Database (NoSQL). There are 4 Endpoints that can be used (consume) by Mobile Development. These endpoints are used to display the cultural data set.
- `/home`
- `/class`
- `/cultural`
- `/detail` <br/>
The Cloud Functions Architecture is here :

The environment we set up in Cloud Run was:
- Build Python App with Flask
- Push Python App to Github
- Create an Image with Docker
- Build in Google Cloud Platform :
  - Clone the app from Github
  - Build the app
  - Push the app 

The Cloud Run Architecture is here :
