# The Documentation of Capstone Project BANGKIT 2022

#### Overview Project :
Indonesia is experiencing rapid development in rural tourism. The Central Statistics Agency
(BPS) recorded that there were around 1,302 tourist villages in 2014, that number jumped to
1,734 villages with the potential to become tourist villages throughout 2018. Many tourist
villages integrated their culture in the form of cultural objects such as sculptures, paintings,
carvings, or building architecture. These cultural objects have fascinating hidden meanings
that describe the cultural identity of the area. However, It is quite unfortunate that general
people do not know the philosophical or historical value of a cultural object. So, the main
question is how can we provide information to tourists about the cultural value of a cultural
object? BudayAI is a tourism cultural app that can provide a piece of information about
Indonesia's cultural ornament. Our app will use ML/DL for the detection of Indonesian Cultural
Ornament from an objection to the form of an Image and will show information about the
detected object like name, origin, history, etc, and might be recommended to the marketplace
based on the detected object. We choose this problem because we believe digitalization of
ornament culture will add unique value and help boost the tourism sector in the village.
